This library makes it simple to:
 1. Start a virtual machine
 1. Upload the currently running classpath to the server
 1. Start an analogue of the current running jvm
 1. Transfer and execute tasks in the form of serializable lambdas

This can also be used an a "local" manner to provide a fork-like execution isolation.
